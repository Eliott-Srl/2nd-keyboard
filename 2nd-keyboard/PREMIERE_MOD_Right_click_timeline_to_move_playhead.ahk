;NOTE: I use the right mouse button for this because my current mouse does not have macro keys on it. I could use the middle mouse button, but it requires too much pressure to push down so often, and you have to be careful not to accidentally scroll it.
;But if you want to use a button other than the right mouse button, the script becomes a lot simpler. Scroll down to the bottom for that script.

;NOTE: This does not, and cannot work on the timeline where there are no tracks visible.
;Explanation: https://twitter.com/boxrNathan/status/927371468371103745
;That is color 0x212121, and last I checked, it shows up in many other places in premiere, not just that part of the timeline.
;The easy solution is to just fill up your timeline with tracks; have no blank space.
